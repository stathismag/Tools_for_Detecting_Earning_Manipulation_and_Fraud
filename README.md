Introduction of several useful tools and models for detecting company's earning manipulation and potential fraud

This is the project from UMN MSBA summer term, Financial Accounting course. Through this assignment, instructor led us to explore several useful tools for fraud and earning management detection.

We use the dataset from Compustat to develop our model and analyses. 

In the project, the logic of my analyses is below:  
A. Cleaning and slicing the data  
B. Simple exploratory data analysis  
C. Indirect evidence of earning management  
D. Benford's Law  
E. Discretionary Accruals Model  
F. Operating Cash Flow and Accruals Model
